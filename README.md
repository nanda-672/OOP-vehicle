## Description
Implement an abstract class called `Vehicle` that has attributes such as the number of wheels, status of the fuel, status of engine turn on/off etc (you're free to add more). This class also has some basic functionality such as refuel, turn on vehicle etc. Implement as many child class as you like. The more object oriented programming concept you use the better.
